# tictactoe

It's 21:58. 
I'm late I know but today I'm sick and to be honest I wasn't gonna code so don't expect that I'm gonna finish the project today.
I'm gonna do a tictactoe game.
See you before midnight.

[update]

It's 23:00.
I think I have done the biggest part of the javascript and to be honest it's a very boring project and I'm sick and tired so I'm gonna leave it like this.
It's not very finished but like I said I'v done the biggest part.
Things to do : 
Identify the winner X or O.
Don't accept other than X when its his turn and O when its his turn.
